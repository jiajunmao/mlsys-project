## Getting started
Run `download.sh` from the scripts folder **under the scripts** folder. Otherwise the relative path might screw up lol. The script is quite primitive.

You would need **java 8** to run the `browsermob-proxy`. Also remember to change the path to your `browsermob-proxy` installation in `util.py`
